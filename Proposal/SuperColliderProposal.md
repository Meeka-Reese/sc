# Supercollider Analysis Project Proposal

For this project I'm looking to analyze Agnes Szelag's song *Lato* from the album [No Summer or Winter](https://agnesszelag.bandcamp.com/album/no-summer-or-winter). I couldn't find the Supercollider patch on their website so I'm contacting Agnes through Instagram. The song is from the class listening list. Lato in particular is a beutiful atmospheric track. I'm really exctited to see into the patch.
